## SEGMENT A: Early Career Builder (Ages 22–35)

### Pension Contributions

1. "People early in their careers often find that even small pension increases—say, 1% more of salary—can grow significantly over 30+ years due to compounding. Many use their next pay rise as an opportunity to increase contributions without feeling the pinch. **If you'd like help working out what increase might work for your budget, one of our advisors can run through the numbers with you.**"

2. "At this stage of your career, many people check whether they're contributing enough to capture their full employer match. Leaving this on the table is sometimes described as turning down free money. **Would you like us to help you check your current matching arrangement? An advisor can review this with you.**"

3. "Some people in your situation find it helpful to set a reminder to review their pension contribution each year, often timing it with their annual pay review. **Our advisors can set up an annual check-in to help you stay on track—would that be useful?**"

4. "Many early-career savers who receive bonuses choose to direct a portion into their pension before it hits their current account—finding it easier not to miss money they haven't seen. **If you'd like to explore how this could work with your employer's scheme, an advisor can walk you through the options.**"

5. "People in similar circumstances often benefit from understanding salary sacrifice: it can reduce National Insurance for both you and your employer, though it's worth checking how it affects things like mortgage affordability calculations. **This can get technical—our advisors can explain how it would work in your specific situation.**"

### Investment Risk

6. "With potentially 30+ years until retirement, many people at this life stage find they can weather short-term market ups and downs. Some choose higher-growth investments, accepting more volatility in exchange for potentially higher long-term returns. **If you're unsure what level of risk feels right for you, an advisor can help you think this through.**"

7. "It's common for people early in their careers to review whether their workplace pension's default fund matches their comfort with investment risk. Some find the default is more cautious than they'd choose themselves. **Would you like an advisor to review your current fund selection with you?**"

8. "Many younger investors find it helpful to remember that market dips, while uncomfortable, have historically been followed by recoveries. Some view downturns as opportunities to buy more units at lower prices. **If market movements are causing you concern, speaking with an advisor can help put things in perspective.**"

9. "People in your situation sometimes check whether they're invested too heavily in cash within their pension—while it feels safe, inflation can erode its value over time. **An advisor can review your current allocation and explain what alternatives might look like.**"

10. "Some early-career savers find target-date funds helpful—these automatically adjust risk as you approach retirement, requiring less active management on your part. **If you'd like to understand whether this approach suits you, our advisors can explain how these funds work.**"

### Managing Multiple Pots

11. "It's common for people who've changed jobs a few times to have several small pension pots. Many find it easier to track their total savings by consolidating them, though it's worth checking for any valuable guarantees before transferring. **Our advisors can help you gather information on your old pensions and check for any features worth keeping.**"

12. "People in similar situations often use the government's Pension Tracing Service to locate old workplace pensions they may have lost track of. **If you'd like help tracking down old pensions, an advisor can guide you through the process.**"

13. "Some people find that having multiple pension pots means paying multiple sets of fees. Consolidating could reduce these, though it's important to compare the charges and features of each scheme first. **An advisor can help you compare your options and work out whether consolidation makes sense.**"

14. "Many people at this career stage find it helpful to keep a simple record of all their pension providers, login details, and approximate values—making future planning much easier. **Would you like an advisor to help you build a complete picture of where you stand?**"

### Building Financial Foundations

15. "Before focusing heavily on long-term savings, many people in your situation prioritise building an emergency fund covering 3–6 months of essential expenses. **An advisor can help you think through how to balance short-term security with longer-term goals.**"

16. "Some people early in their careers balance pension saving with paying down high-interest debt first—the interest on credit cards often exceeds potential investment returns. **If you're juggling debt and savings, an advisor can help you think through the priorities.**"

17. "Many find it helpful to use the 50/30/20 approach as a starting framework: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, 20% on savings and debt repayment—though everyone's circumstances differ. **Our advisors can help you create a budget that reflects your actual situation and goals.**"

18. "People in your situation sometimes benefit from understanding how student loan repayments interact with pension contributions—salary sacrifice can affect the amount you repay. **This interaction can be complex—an advisor can model how different choices affect your take-home pay.**"

19. "Some early-career savers use a Lifetime ISA alongside their workplace pension for additional tax-efficient retirement savings, particularly if they don't have access to employer matching on additional contributions. **If you're wondering whether a LISA makes sense for you, an advisor can explain the trade-offs.**"

20. "Many people at this stage find it useful to understand the difference between their pension's fund value and its projected retirement income—the two can feel quite different. **An advisor can help translate your current savings into what they might mean for your future.**"

---

## SEGMENT B: Mid-Career Accumulator (Ages 36–50)

### Maximising Tax Efficiency

21. "People at this career stage often review whether they could benefit from increasing pension contributions, particularly if they're higher-rate taxpayers—pension contributions receive tax relief at your marginal rate. **An advisor can calculate exactly how much tax relief you'd receive on additional contributions.**"

22. "Some people in your situation explore salary sacrifice for pension contributions. As a higher earner, this can provide National Insurance savings on top of income tax relief. **If you'd like to understand the full tax impact, an advisor can model this for your specific salary.**"

23. "Many mid-career professionals check whether they have unused pension annual allowance from the previous three tax years that could be carried forward. **Our advisors can check your carry-forward position and help you understand how much room you have.**"

24. "People in similar circumstances sometimes find that pension contributions can help manage their adjusted net income—potentially retaining child benefit or personal allowance. **This requires careful calculation—an advisor can show you exactly where the thresholds sit for your situation.**"

25. "Some find it helpful to review their overall tax wrapper strategy: pensions offer tax relief on the way in, while ISAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Many use both for flexibility. **An advisor can help you think through the right balance for your goals and tax position.**"

### Getting Clarity on Total Position

26. "At this stage, many people find value in gathering all their pension information in one place. The government's Pension Dashboard service can help you see your various pots together. **Would you like an advisor to help you build a complete picture of your retirement savings?**"

27. "People in your situation often request updated pension statements from all their providers, checking that the projected retirement income still aligns with their expectations. **Our advisors can help you interpret these projections and what they mean for your retirement plans.**"

28. "Some mid-career savers find it useful to check their State Pension forecast at gov.uk—understanding this foundation helps with planning additional private pension needs. **An advisor can help you factor your State Pension into your overall retirement income picture.**"

29. "Many people at this life stage review whether they have gaps in their National Insurance record that could be worth filling to maximise their State Pension entitlement. **If you're unsure whether filling gaps makes sense, an advisor can help you weigh up the costs and benefits.**"

30. "People in similar circumstances sometimes discover old pensions with valuable guaranteed annuity rates or other benefits—it's worth checking before considering any transfers. **Our advisors can review your old pensions for hidden value before you make any decisions.**"

### Investment Strategy Review

31. "Some people in your situation review whether their pension investments still match their timeline. With 15–25 years to retirement, many still have appetite for growth-focused strategies. **An advisor can help you assess whether your current investment approach still fits your timeline and goals.**"

32. "Many mid-career investors check whether their various pensions are invested consistently with their overall risk tolerance, or whether they've ended up with a mismatch. **Would you like an advisor to review your investments across all your pensions?**"

33. "People at this stage sometimes consider whether they're over-concentrated in their employer's shares—through share schemes, bonuses, or company pension investments. **An advisor can help you understand your overall exposure and think through diversification options.**"

34. "Some find this a good time to understand the specific funds within their pension and their associated charges—small differences in fees compound significantly over time. **Our advisors can break down your fund charges and explain what you're paying for.**"

35. "Many people in your situation review their pension's lifestyle or target-date glide path to understand when and how it will start reducing investment risk. **If you'd like to understand or adjust your glide path, an advisor can walk you through the options.**"

### Life Event Considerations

36. "People going through divorce often benefit from understanding how pensions are treated in settlements—they're frequently the second-largest asset after property. **This is a complex area—our advisors can help you understand the pension aspects of your situation.**"

37. "Some in your situation who are caring for children or elderly relatives check how career breaks affect their pension and State Pension entitlements. **An advisor can help you understand the long-term impact and explore ways to protect your retirement savings.**"

38. "Many mid-career professionals receiving inheritances consider how to deploy them tax-efficiently—pensions, ISAs, and other options each have different implications. **If you've received or expect an inheritance, an advisor can help you think through the options.**"

39. "People in similar circumstances sometimes review their death benefits and expression of wishes forms, ensuring their pension would go to their intended beneficiaries. **An advisor can help you review your nominations and explain how pension death benefits work.**"

40. "Some find this a natural time to consider protection needs—understanding how their family would manage financially if they couldn't work or died prematurely. **Our advisors can help you assess what protection might be appropriate for your circumstances.**"

---

## SEGMENT C: Pre-Retirement Planner (Ages 51–60)

### Understanding Your Options

41. "People approaching retirement often benefit from understanding the main options: taking some or all as cash, buying a guaranteed income (annuity), keeping it invested and drawing down, or a combination of these. **An advisor can explain each option in detail and help you think through what matters most to you.**"

42. "Many in your situation find it helpful to understand that the 25% tax-free lump sum can be taken all at once, or in stages over time—each approach has different implications. **If you'd like to explore the trade-offs, an advisor can model different scenarios for you.**"

43. "Some people at this stage explore whether a phased retirement suits them—gradually reducing work hours while drawing some pension income. **Our advisors can help you understand how phased retirement could work with your pension and employment situation.**"

44. "People in similar circumstances often check whether they have any defined benefit (final salary) pensions, which work differently from defined contribution pots and require different planning. **If you have a DB pension, an advisor can explain your specific options and what they're worth.**"

45. "Many find it valuable to understand the difference between their pension pot value and the income it might provide—annuity rates and sustainable withdrawal rates help translate between the two. **An advisor can help you understand what your pot might mean in terms of actual retirement income.**"

### Risk and Investment Review

46. "As retirement approaches, many people review whether their investment risk level remains appropriate. Some prefer to reduce volatility; others maintain growth exposure if they plan to stay invested through retirement. **An advisor can help you think through what approach suits your plans and comfort level.**"

47. "People in your situation sometimes check whether their pension has an automatic 'lifestyling' feature that's moving them to lower-risk investments—and whether the timing and destination suit their plans. **If you're unsure what's happening with your investments, an advisor can review this with you.**"

48. "Some pre-retirees find that if they plan to use drawdown rather than buy an annuity immediately, they may not need to de-risk as aggressively as traditional glide paths suggest. **An advisor can help you align your investment approach with your intended retirement strategy.**"

49. "Many at this stage consider keeping different 'buckets' for different time horizons: cash for near-term needs, bonds for medium-term, equities for longer-term. **Our advisors can help you think through a bucket strategy tailored to your situation.**"

50. "People approaching retirement often review the charges on their pension—high fees become more impactful when you're drawing down rather than accumulating. **An advisor can compare your current charges with alternatives and help you understand the long-term impact.**"

### State Pension and Timing

51. "Many people in your situation check their State Pension forecast and consider whether deferring it (for an increased amount) or taking it on time better suits their circumstances. **An advisor can help you model different State Pension timing scenarios alongside your private pensions.**"

52. "Some find it helpful to review their National Insurance record before State Pension age—filling gaps can increase your entitlement, but there are time limits. **Our advisors can help you check your record and work out whether filling gaps makes financial sense.**"

53. "People at this stage often consider how the timing of private and State Pension income affects their tax position in early retirement. **An advisor can help you plan the sequence of income to minimise your tax bill across retirement.**"

54. "Many pre-retirees with a younger spouse explore how their State Pension timing interacts with their partner's situation and their joint retirement income needs. **If you're planning as a couple, an advisor can help you coordinate your retirement income strategies.**"

55. "Some people find it useful to understand that State Pension increases each year by the 'triple lock'—currently the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. **An advisor can help you factor likely State Pension growth into your long-term planning.**"

### Practical Preparation

56. "People approaching retirement often benefit from building up accessible cash savings to avoid drawing from their pension during market downturns. **An advisor can help you work out how much cash buffer might be appropriate for your situation.**"

57. "Many in your situation create a detailed picture of their expected retirement expenses—distinguishing between essential costs and discretionary spending. **Our advisors can help you build a retirement budget and stress-test it against your income sources.**"

58. "Some pre-retirees find it helpful to 'practice' living on their expected retirement budget for a few months while still working. **If you'd like help creating a realistic budget to test, an advisor can work through this with you.**"

59. "People at this stage sometimes review their mortgage situation—some prefer to clear it before retirement; others find low-rate mortgages worth maintaining. **An advisor can help you weigh up the pros and cons for your specific circumstances.**"

60. "Many find it valuable to consider their housing plans: staying put, downsizing, or relocating—each has significant financial implications for retirement planning. **Our advisors can help you factor housing decisions into your overall retirement plan.**"

## SEGMENT D: At-Retirement Decision Maker (Ages 60+, at decision point)

### Taking the Tax-Free Lump Sum

61. "Many people in your situation take some or all of their 25% tax-free entitlement while deciding on the rest of their pension. This doesn't commit you to any particular path for the remaining 75%. **An advisor can help you think through how much to take and when.**"

62. "Some at-retirement decision-makers find it helpful to consider whether they need the tax-free cash immediately, or whether leaving it invested (to potentially grow further) better suits their situation. **If you're weighing up this decision, an advisor can model different scenarios.**"

63. "People in similar circumstances sometimes split their tax-free cash: taking some now for specific needs, while preserving the option to take more later through phased drawdown. **Our advisors can explain how phased withdrawal works and whether it might suit your plans.**"

64. "Many find it useful to understand that once you take taxable income from your pension, the amount you can contribute in future may be significantly restricted (the Money Purchase Annual Allowance). **This is an important consideration—an advisor can explain how it applies to your situation.**"

65. "Some people at this stage consider using tax-free cash to clear debts, create an emergency fund, or cover planned major expenses—reducing their ongoing income needs. **An advisor can help you think through the best use of your tax-free entitlement.**"

### Annuity Considerations

66. "If you're considering a guaranteed income for life, many people benefit from shopping around rather than accepting their existing provider's rate. An annuity broker can compare the whole market on your behalf. **We can connect you with a whole-of-market annuity broker, or an advisor can explain how the process works.**"

67. "People with health conditions or lifestyle factors (like smoking) often qualify for enhanced annuity rates. Many find their guaranteed income is higher than they expected when these factors are considered. **An advisor can help you understand whether you might qualify for an enhanced rate.**"

68. "Some in your situation explore the trade-offs between annuity features: joint-life coverage, inflation linking, and guarantee periods all affect the starting income level. **Our advisors can explain how different features affect your income and help you think through the trade-offs.**"

69. "Many at-retirement decision-makers find it helpful to understand that annuity rates vary based on gilt yields—timing can affect the income you lock in for life. **If you're considering an annuity, an advisor can help you understand current market conditions.**"

70. "People in similar circumstances sometimes consider using part of their pension for a guaranteed income (covering essential expenses) while keeping the rest in drawdown for flexibility. **An advisor can help you model a blended approach and see what it might look like.**"

### Drawdown Decisions

71. "If you're considering drawdown, many people find the '4% rule' a useful starting point for sustainable withdrawals—though your actual sustainable rate depends on your specific circumstances, time horizon, and market conditions. **An advisor can help you calculate a sustainable withdrawal rate based on your situation.**"

72. "People in your situation often think about their withdrawal strategy: some take a fixed percentage of their pot each year; others take a fixed amount; others take only natural income. Each has different implications. **Our advisors can explain the different approaches and help you think through which might work for you.**"

73. "Many at-retirement decision-makers consider the sequence-of-returns risk: significant market falls early in retirement can have a larger impact than the same falls later. Some build cash buffers to manage this. **An advisor can help you build a strategy that accounts for this risk.**"

74. "Some people in drawdown find it helpful to review their withdrawal rate annually, adjusting based on how their pot has performed and how their spending needs have changed. **Would you like to set up an annual review with an advisor to keep your drawdown on track?**"

75. "People at this stage sometimes explore 'guardrails' approaches: pre-defined rules for increasing withdrawals when markets do well and reducing them after downturns. **An advisor can help you design a flexible withdrawal strategy with built-in guardrails.**"

### Ongoing Management

76. "Many in your situation review their pension investments for drawdown—the ideal approach during accumulation may differ from what works while drawing income. **An advisor can help you review whether your investments are still appropriate for this new phase.**"

77. "People at retirement often update their expression of wishes for death benefits, ensuring their remaining pension would pass to their intended beneficiaries efficiently. **Our advisors can help you review your nominations and understand the tax implications for your beneficiaries.**"

78. "Some find it valuable to understand how their pension income interacts with their State Pension and any other income—including implications for their tax bracket. **An advisor can help you plan your income to minimise tax across all your sources.**"

79. "Many at-retirement decision-makers consider whether they want to remain involved in investment decisions or prefer a managed drawdown service that handles this for them. **If you'd like to explore managed options, an advisor can explain what's available.**"

80. "People in similar circumstances sometimes review whether their current pension provider's drawdown charges and features are competitive, or whether transferring could be beneficial. **Our advisors can compare your current arrangement with alternatives and explain the pros and cons of switching.**"

---

## SEGMENT E: Cautious Cash Holder (Any age, preference for security)

### Understanding Cash Trade-offs

81. "Many people who prefer the security of cash find it helpful to understand how inflation affects purchasing power over time. A rate of 3% inflation halves your money's buying power in roughly 24 years. **If you're concerned about inflation eating into your savings, an advisor can help you think through your options.**"

82. "People in your situation often compare their cash savings rate to current inflation—understanding whether their money is growing, staying flat, or gradually declining in real terms. **An advisor can help you review your current position and explore alternatives if you're interested.**"

83. "Some cautious savers find it useful to think about their money in 'buckets': cash for short-term needs and emergencies, with longer-term money potentially working harder. **Our advisors can help you think through a bucket approach that respects your need for security.**"

84. "Many who are uncomfortable with investment risk explore the range of options between pure cash and equity markets—there's a spectrum, not a binary choice. **If you'd like to understand the middle ground options, an advisor can walk you through them without any pressure.**"

85. "People in similar circumstances sometimes find it helpful to understand that short-term volatility and long-term risk are different things. Cash feels stable but carries inflation risk; investments feel volatile but may preserve purchasing power. **An advisor can help you think through what 'risk' really means for your goals.**"

### Tax-Efficient Cash Options

86. "Many cash savers benefit from fully using their annual ISA allowance to shelter interest from tax. Cash ISAs exist specifically for those who prefer not to invest in the stock market. **An advisor can help you check whether you're making the most of your ISA allowances.**"

87. "People in your situation often check whether they're using their Personal Savings Allowance effectively—basic-rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free outside ISAs. **Our advisors can review your savings to ensure you're not paying unnecessary tax.**"

88. "Some cautious savers explore Premium Bonds as a tax-free alternative to cash savings—while returns vary, the prizes are free of income tax and capital gains tax. **If you'd like to understand how Premium Bonds compare to other options, an advisor can explain the trade-offs.**"

89. "Many find it helpful to review their cash across providers—the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects up to £85,000 per banking institution. **An advisor can help you check your FSCS coverage and ensure your savings are fully protected.**"

90. "People in similar circumstances sometimes compare fixed-rate and easy-access savings accounts, considering whether locking money away for a better rate suits their need for flexibility. **Our advisors can help you find the right balance between rate and access.**"

### Gradual Approaches for the Risk-Averse

91. "For those uncomfortable committing a lump sum to investments, many people find 'drip-feeding' helpful—investing smaller amounts regularly over time to smooth out market highs and lows. **If this approach interests you, an advisor can explain how it works and help you get started gradually.**"

92. "Some cautious savers explore low-volatility or defensive funds as a middle ground—these aim for steadier returns than equity markets, though they're not risk-free. **An advisor can explain the range of lower-risk investment options and help you find one that matches your comfort level.**"

93. "People in your situation sometimes find multi-asset funds with a cautious or conservative risk rating align better with their preferences than pure equity funds. **Our advisors can show you options designed for cautious investors and explain how they work.**"

94. "Many who are nervous about investing find it easier to start with a small amount they can afford to lose, gaining experience before committing more. **If you'd like to dip your toe in, an advisor can help you take a small first step with minimal risk.**"

95. "Some cautious investors find it helpful to set a time horizon: committing to leave money invested for at least 5 years can make short-term volatility easier to tolerate. **An advisor can help you think through what timeline makes sense for different portions of your savings.**"

### Practical Security Measures

96. "People who prioritise security often ensure they have adequate protection insurance in place—life cover, income protection, and critical illness cover can provide financial security against life events. **Our advisors can help you assess whether you have the right protection in place.**"

97. "Many cautious savers find it valuable to review the guaranteed elements of their existing pensions—some older policies have valuable guarantees that may affect how you think about risk elsewhere. **An advisor can check your pensions for guaranteed benefits you might not be aware of.**"

98. "Some in your situation explore NS&I (National Savings & Investments) products, which are backed by HM Treasury—offering a different kind of security than FSCS-protected bank accounts. **If you'd like to understand NS&I options, an advisor can explain what's available.**"

99. "People who prefer certainty sometimes find annuities appealing for retirement income—a guaranteed income for life, regardless of market conditions or how long you live. **An advisor can help you understand whether an annuity might give you the security you're looking for.**"

100. "Many cautious savers benefit from writing down their specific concerns about investing—often, understanding and naming the risks helps in thinking through whether they apply to your situation and timeframe. **Our advisors are happy to talk through your concerns without any obligation—sometimes a conversation helps clarify what matters most to you.**"

## Key Compliance Notes

✅ **Handoffs remain compliant because they:**
- Offer help understanding options, not recommendations
- Reference the consumer's "situation" or "circumstances" generically
- Invite further conversation rather than directing action
- Position the advisor as a resource, not a requirement

❌ **Avoided crossing into advice by not saying:**
- "You need to speak with an advisor"
- "An advisor will recommend the right product for you"
- "You should book an appointment to get proper advice"
- "Without advice, you risk making the wrong decision"
